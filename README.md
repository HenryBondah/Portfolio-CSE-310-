This is a simple Python program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Python program and serves as an introduction to this class and most of the things i will be doing.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this software is to learn the process of developing and publishing a simple program using GitHub, including proper documentation and demonstration. This project also allows me to familiarize myself with Python and GitHub tools.
